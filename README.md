# The battle of 2 armies assignment

The app lets the user input two numbers representing the number of soldiers in each army; then, a random generator function assigns them to 3 different units: grunts, generals and mages. Each unit multiplies with a certain multiplier, which gives the power level of the army when combined.  Using the function to calculate the army's power level determines who is the winner. When a winner is decided, a user is represented with the lining of each army and who won the battle.
