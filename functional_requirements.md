4.	Program must use the following multipliers for each type of unit: Grunt * 2, General * 4, Mage * 8
5.	For each army, the program must multiply each calculated unit type with their multiplier, the sum of all three units will give the total power level of each army. 
6.	Application must display the calculated number of each unit for both armies. 
7.	Based on each army's power level calculation, the application must display a winner army. If power levels are equal application will declare a draw.
